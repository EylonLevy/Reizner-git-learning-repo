# Reizner-git-learning-repo

Welcome to the learning zone.

Here, just like in the Matrix Movie, you have two options to choose from.

You can learn git the right way and the easy way. Which one is better? Definitely the latter but it will require some effort and maybe some tears, blood and sweat.

The easy way - You will propably learn the basic but that's about it. Go to this site and have fun https://learngitbranching.js.org/.

The right way - You will try to learn everything by yourself without guidence. this will hone your learning skills and it is the upmost important skill for any developer.

The hard way exercises:

Download "git bash"

Learn how to clone this repo (find out what that means).

Add a file named hello world and put a smaily face in it.

Upload the file so you could see it here in github.

Read on what is a branch

Create a new branch

Create a file named hello-branch1

Upload this branch to github.

Create from the master a new branch and create a file named hello-branch2

Make hello-branch2 appear in the master using one command

Make the master in github show hello-branch2
